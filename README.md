# ContactsManagerSystem
The Contact Management System is a Java-based console application designed to simplify the management of personal and professional contacts. The system allows users to create,  update, delete, and search for contacts while maintaining a record of changes through activity logs. By leveraging object-oriented programming principles, the application aims to ensure 
code maintainability, reusability, and scalability. The primary objectives of this project are:
• To provide a centralized platform for managing contacts.
• To demonstrate effective use of object-oriented principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
• To implement user-friendly functionalities such as sorting, searching, and importing/exporting contacts from CSV files
